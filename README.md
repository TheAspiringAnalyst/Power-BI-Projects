# Introduction

This project is being done using the dataset provided by the Maven Analytics. This project has been done completely without any external help.
The project is basically about making an end-to-end business intelligence solution for a multinational grocery chain client so that they can get an insight into all the core parameters required to take necessary business decisions.

##  :beginner: Details of Project

There are multiple csv files containing raw data given by our demo client containing details with thousands of rows. 
I had to perform everything from scratch -shaping the data, creating the data model, adding DAX measures and finally creating the report to visualize the data.

## :beginner: Major DAX functions used in this project are Date and Time functions, Text functions, Logical functions (if/and/or), RELATED, CALCULATED AND ALL, CALCULATED AND FILTER, Iterator functions and Time-Intelligence formulas.
